Do I need a fucking jacket?

A location based weather suggestion to wear a jacket or not.

This web app takes your location (either from geolocation.getCurrentPosition or your city and country if location services are disabled) and accesses weather data for the next 18 hours, then makes a jacket suggestion based on temperature, wind speed, and chance of rain.
